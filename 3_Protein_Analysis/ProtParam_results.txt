Extinction coefficients:
Extinction coefficients are in units of  M-1 cm-1, at 280 nm measured in water.
Ext. coefficient    28085
Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   0.782, assuming all pairs of Cys residues form cystines
Ext. coefficient    27960
Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   0.778, assuming all Cys residues are reduced

Estimated half-life:
The N-terminal of the sequence considered is M (Met).
The estimated half-life is: 30 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro).
                            >20 hours (yeast, in vivo).
                            >10 hours (Escherichia coli, in vivo).

Instability index:
The instability index (II) is computed to be 33.07
This classifies the protein as stable.
