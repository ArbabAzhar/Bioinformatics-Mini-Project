Functional Prediction for ORF 6:

Based on InterPro and Pfam analysis, ORF 6 contains a Cytochrome P450 domain. 
Cytochrome P450 proteins are involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and the metabolism of small molecules. 
Therefore, ORF 6 is likely to function as an oxidoreductase and may participate in secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
